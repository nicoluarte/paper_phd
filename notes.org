** neural representation
** ripples
** spectral power
** distributed pattern of spectral power
** band power
** volumen conduction
- Volume conduction is the term used to describe the effects of recording
  electrical potentials at a distance from their source generator. Is the noise
  caused by electrical spread
** coupled ripple oscillations
** bipolar reference
- Mainly used to augment signal to noise ratio. Common noise between electrodes
  is discarded, and only signal remains (that which is not common)
** phase differences
** lag phase
** ripple band
** temporal region of interest
* Importante phrases
** coupled ripples may be relevant for succesful memory retrieval
** coupled ripples may reinstantiate neural representations of memory from respective encoding periods
** coupled ripples may constitutea neural mechanism for actively retrieving memory representations in the human brain
